This is the full stack interview project for Anch.io made by Boris Stankov.

## Technologies used:

front-end: Angular14 

backend: nestJS 

## Run the project:

To run the project you need to first install **Angular CLI** and **Nest CLI** 

angular cli : npm install -g @angular/cli
nest cli :  npm install -g @nestjs/cli

After that you need to cd back-end and install all the node modules by typing npm install 

Once you have the back-end modules you can start the backend by typing: 
npm run start:dev

then you need to cd front-end/ and npm install all the node modules as well. 
and after that you need to start the front end as well by typing: 
ng serve

this should start both the BE and the FE. 

in case there is any problems with starting the project **please contact me** @ Boris.stankovv@gmail.com (this is my personal Email and I will try to answer ASAP)

## How to use the project

Once the FE is loaded you will immediately be taken to the table that needed to be made.

Then you can change to the Data Visualisation route by clicking the Data Visualisation button in the toolback above.  


## Is the project perfect? 

Absolutely not I did as much as I could in the given time-frame there are things that do not fully work, also there are hard coded values that should be dynamic. Thats something that im fully aware of and would like to further elaborate on the last meeting.

## How I got the data for the table 

I exported the database from ADS to json and basiacly hard-coded as the response from the API. 

# Finaly a big thank you for the time and consideration
